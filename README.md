ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Weimin Liu. I am an interdisciplinary geochemist and data scientist working at MARUM, University of Bremen. I use molecular fingerprints to trace (bio)geochemical processes in modern oceans, recent sediments, and ancient reservoirs. By applying targeted and untargeted cheminformatics, I transform complex geochemical data into new insights on Earthâ€™s inner workings.
